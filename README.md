# FreshCart

Route Final Project — FreshCart

FreshCart is a front-end e-commerce project (Route final project) built with plain JavaScript, CSS and HTML. It provides a small, responsive shopping experience for browsing products, adding items to a cart, and completing a checkout form. The project is intended as a learning/demo app and a foundation you can extend.

## Features
- Product listing & details
- Search and/or basic filtering (if implemented)
- Add to cart and update quantities
- Cart persisted in localStorage (so items remain across refreshes)
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Context to handle state

Note: Feature availability depends on the current repository implementation — treat the list above as expected/typical for this type of project and extend as needed.

## Tech Stack
- Reactjs
- TailwindCss
- Context

According to the repository metadata, the codebase is primarily JavaScript, with CSS and a small amount of HTML.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git (to clone the repository)
- A modern web browser
- Optional: Node.js and npm if you want to run a local dev server with packages like `live-server`, `http-server`, or a bundler

### Installation (two options)

Option A — Quick (open locally)
1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/EbrahimNasserr/FreshCart.git
2. Open the project folder and open `index.html` in your browser.

Option B — Use a local static server (recommended for SPA routing or module usage)
1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/EbrahimNasserr/FreshCart.git
2. Change into the project directory
   cd FreshCart
3. If you have Node.js, install a simple static server (if not already installed globally):
   npm install -g live-server
4. Start the server:
   live-server
   or
   npx http-server

If the repository contains a `package.json` with scripts, you can instead run:
   npm install
   npm run start

(Adjust commands if a particular dev script exists.)

## Project Structure
This is a suggested/typical layout — update to match the repository's actual structure.
- index.html — main entry page
- /css — stylesheets
- /src — application JavaScript
- /assets — images, icons, data
- /components — reusable UI pieces (if used)

## Development
- Use browser devtools to inspect and debug UI and JavaScript.
- To add features:
  - Create or modify files under `js/` and `css/`.
  - Keep state persistence in localStorage for a simple cart.
  - Validate forms using HTML5 constraints and JS for extra checks.

## Testing
- Manual testing in multiple browsers and mobile viewports.
- If test framework is added later (Jest, Cypress), include instructions here.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Add ..."`
4. Push to your fork and open a pull request

Please include a description of changes and any setup steps.
